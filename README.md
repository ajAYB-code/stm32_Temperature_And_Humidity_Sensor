This capstone project showcases a desktop application designed to visualize environmental data, specifically temperature and humidity. The data is collected using the SHT35 sensor, stored in an SQLite database, and elegantly displayed using ElectronJS.

## Features

- **Real-time Data Monitoring**: Continuously read temperature and humidity data from the SHT35 sensor.
- **Data Storage**: Store the collected data in an SQLite database for persistence and analysis.
- **Elegant Visualization**: Display current temperature and humidity in a user-friendly interface.
- **Graphical Representation**: Visualize historical data trends with interactive graphs.
- **Cross-platform**: The application is built with ElectronJS, making it compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
